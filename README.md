# BLACKJACK-CARD-GAME
Blackjack card game implemented in python.
Uses OOP and functions.

## OBJECTIVE OF THE GAME
Each participant attempts to beat the dealer by getting a count as close to 21 as possible, without going over 21.

## CARD VALUES/SCORING
It is up to each individual player if an ace is worth 1 or 11. Face cards are 10 and any other card is its own value.

The game needs to have one player versus an automated dealer.

## HOW TO PLAY
The player must be able to pick their betting amount.
The dealer deals 2 cards to the player and 2 cards to theymselves.
Both player cards are visible, but only one of the dealer cards are visible.
The sum of the values of the cards is the count.
The player must try to get the count as close to 21.
Thus the player may stand(dont pick another card) or hit(pick one more card)
After the player hits, it is the dealer's turn to do the same.

## TO END
Whoever gets the closes value below 21 WINS!
If any person gets a value above 21 they BUST! Thus they lose the bet.
If any player gets exactly 21, it is a BLACKJACK! They instantly win!
